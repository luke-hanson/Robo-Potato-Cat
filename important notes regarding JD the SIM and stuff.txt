JD joint measurement notes
	servo joint unit length = 60mm / 1 "unit" in the code
	servo joint 50mm wide
	servo joint 20mm thick
	body width 95mm
	body height 60mm
	body depth 60mm
	shoulder y rotation to shoulder x rotation 30mm
	"neck" 30mm shoulder to base of head
	head diameter 80mm
	foot length 110mm
	ankle to heel 30mm
	ankle to toe 80mm
	foot width 70mm
	ankle to inner foot 30mm
	ankle to outer foot 40mm
	hips are 60mm apart
	
in the simulation looking at JD from the starting orienation
	x=width y=depth z=height
	
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
	the "center" of JD body ie the point that all the bit "attach" is at the bottom-center of his body box
	basicaly look at his body from the bottom; the point in the exact center is the EXACT place that all joint measuments extrapolate from
